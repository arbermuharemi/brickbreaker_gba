Welcome to the game of Brick Breaker!

Your objective: break all the bricks! Don't let the ball fall below the paddle, or else you'll lose D:

The controls are simple, press the START button to start the game, then the A button to launch the ball!

Use the LEFT and RIGHT buttons to move the paddle. If the ball comes in contact with the walls, bricks, or paddle, it'll change direction, so always keep your eye on the ball!

You want to position the paddle so that it is under the ball before the ball falls below the paddle's surface! This lets you hit the ball and get back to your brickbreaking havoc!

Winning the game is easy -- all you have to do is break all the bricks. Are you up to the challenge?

NOTE: You can press the SELECT key at any time during the game to return to the start screen.

HAVE FUN :D
